# Data-Science-projects
 In this repository, you will find a variety of data science projects covering a wide range of topics, such as:
 
## Machine Learning: Projects that involve the development and deployment of machine learning models for tasks like classification, regression, and clustering.
## Data Visualisation: Projects that focus on visualising data to gain insights and tell compelling stories through graphs, charts, and interactive dashboards.
## Natural Language Processing (NLP): Projects that deal with text data, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and language generation.
## Time Series Analysis: Projects that explore time-dependent data, forecasting, and anomaly detection.
## Big Data and Distributed Computing: Projects that leverage big data technologies like Apache Spark or Hadoop for large-scale data analysis.

# Project Structure
Each project in this repository follows a consistent structure for organisation:

* README.md: Contains detailed information about the project, including its objectives, data sources, methodology, and results.

* code/: Houses the codebase for the project. This directory is typically organised into subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific stage of the data science pipeline (e.g., data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation).

* data/: Contains the dataset(s) used in the project. In some cases, due to large file sizes, the data may be stored externally with instructions on how to obtain it.

* notebooks/: If Jupyter notebooks are used in the project, they will be stored here for easy exploration and experimentation.

* images/: Contains images and visualisations generated during the project. These visuals help in understanding the data and results.
